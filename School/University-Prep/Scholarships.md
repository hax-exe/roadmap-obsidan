AES Engineering Scholarships Deadline: October 8, 2024

AES Engineering is pleased to be able to continue offering $500 scholarships to motivated students to help in the furthering of their education.

Scholarship Criteria

Our belief is that achieving a high grade point average should not be the only criteria for determining who deserves to be helped. For that reason we are offering a scholarship that will be awarded on the basis of character, as determined by an evaluation of the essays that are submitted.

Scholarships are intended for our future leaders across a wide spectrum of fields of study. This award is available to high school seniors and all students attending a post secondary educational facility.

You are not required to be taking Engineering courses to be eligible.

How to Apply

Students must submit an essay of between 500 and 1000 words in answer to the following question:

When you look back on your life in 30 years, what would it take for you to consider your life successful? What relationships or accomplishments will be important on this journey?

Submit essay to scholarships@aesengineers.com

There is no application packet for this award. Please do not include your resume at this time.

Be sure to include your full name as well as the name of the school you are attending this year and your plans for next year.

Recognizing the impact of the increased cost of living on many of our students, additional bursary funding for those facing housing and food insecurity will be included in our program for the 2024/2025 year to allow us to better support the financial challenges many are facing.

Once you've been accepted to Dalhousie, you can apply for bursaries.  See the link below for details.
